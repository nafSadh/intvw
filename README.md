Interview Prep Resources
========================
`> draft v0.3`

Preparing for software engineering interview needs time, attention and practice; and to help with that, there are many 
resources sprinkled all over the internet and bookshelves. Some of them are wonderful and some of them are meh. Browsing
through these can be overwhelming.  
Therefore, I have tried to create ***a curated list of resources*** -- these are just some of the good options you can 
chose from. To help you decide on which resource to try, I have annotated each item.   
By no means, you have to go through all of it. I do not claim that, these are the best resource out there either; there
must be resources I don't know about which are even better and there might be some resource which I haven't included 
but is useful to someone else.  
I would suggest you to go through some of the articles and look at some of the study plans. Then pick one learning 
resource (book/course/lecture series) and one practice resource. It is best to learn something everyday and practice a
bit everyday. 

*Good luck & have fun!*

## Articles
> Here are some insightful articles. All of them are personal takes on interview process and/or how to ace them. 

- [**ABC: Always Be Coding**](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2): "there窶冱 no silver 
 bullet to getting hired. But, as an engineer, the best thing you can do is to ABC: Always Be Coding" -- this is a nice 
 in a nutshell guide for every one. 

- Ex-Googler, blogger **Steve Yegge**[竊余(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge) wrote his famous note on how to 
 [get that job at Google](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html). This is a bit dated, 
 but still remains relevant.

- [**Get that job at Facebook**
 ](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/get-that-job-at-facebook/10150964382448920) -- a former Facebook
 engineer describes how Facebook hiring works and how to prepare for it. 
 
 - [**The 2 types of software engineering interviews...**
 ](https://medium.com/employbl/the-2-types-of-software-engineering-interviews-and-how-to-prepare-for-them-2e7bd4daa0b) 
 discusses about two broad categories of software engineering interviews: (1) domain specific interviews and 
 (2) computer science fundamentals interviews.
 


## Study Plan
- **[Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)** -- this became a wildly 
 popular compendium of resources for self-paced software engineering training. John Washam wanted to gear up himself 
 as a software engineer and embarked on an [8 month long journey
 ](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13) 
 towards being an skilled software engineer. This study plan is overly comprehensive and as John mentioned, few times, 
 you do not need to go through everything he went through. My personal recommendation is to go through some of the 
 articles and pick up at least one algorithm book (more on it later) and one coding prep book/website (more on it later 
 as well). This directory lists a lot of good reading material on specific topic collected from various sources; don't 
 be voracious, eat healthy and read as needed. 

- [**Ace the coding interview, every time**
 ](https://medium.com/@nickciubotariu/ace-the-coding-interview-every-time-d169ce1fd3fc) -- An Amazon engineer's take on
 how not to fail any technical interview. 

- Andyy Hope on [**software engineering interviews**
 ](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/software-engineering-interviews-744380f4f2af) -- a recent article outlining how he 
 prepared for and got hired at Facebook. 
 
 - [The **30-minute guide** to rocking your next coding interview
 ](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/coding-interviews-for-dummies-5e048933b82b) -- a recent NUS grad's reflection on how 
 he prepared for tech interviews. Yangshun Tay[竊余(http://yangshun.im/) now works as a front-end engineer at Facebook. 
 Oh, and this guide comes with a [handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook).

## On Books
> There are plethora of books on algorithms, problem solving, software engineering and computer science in general.
 There are also, as many book-lists. One thing, I'd like to mention is that, picking up a good book is important. 
 In many cases people are in a time crunch. So, you want to study a book which you can cover within a limited time; 
 similarly, you would want to learn enough and understand them correctly. 
>
> There are people who have studied and compared a good number of books. What they have to say about these books can 
 give you sufficient insight for picking up the right book. 

- [Shawn Bullock's Quora answer on best algorithms and data structures books
 ](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-on-algorithms-and-data-structures/answer/Shawn-Bullock-7) -- this 
 answer is probably one of the most comprehensive overview of good algorithm books. I mostly agree with him, except, I 
 have much more reverence for CLRS than he has. I'm glad that he likes Sedgewick too. 

- [Programming Algorithms & Data Structures
 ](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/126971.Programming_Algorithms_Data_Structures) -- a Goodreads list of well 
 recognized and revered books on programming algorithms, data structures, problem solving and programming challenges.

- [A comparison of four algorithms 
 textbooks](https://porgionesanke.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/a-comparison-of-four-algorithms-textbooks/): 
 Knuth, CLRS, DPV, Skiena.

- An [annotated list of programming books](https://danluu.com/programming-books/) by Dan Luu.


### Book List
> Following are some books I studied or vetted and are in my to-read list.

#### Algorithms and data structures

- 泅 **Sedgewick** -- I read his [Algorithms in C++](http://a.co/d/9cUnqJI) during my freshman and sophomore years and I 
 loved how he handled some very intricate topics. Later on I also looked at the more updated 
 [Algorithms 4e](http://a.co/d/0LDYqsh) in conjunction with his Coursera courses 
 [1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), 
 [2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2). Another book he authored focuses on 
 [analysis of algorithms](http://aofa.cs.princeton.edu/) and thus more mathematical in nature. 

- 沒 **CLRS** -- [Introduction to Algorithms (3e)](http://a.co/d/aVnF8Eu) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein -- this 
 is undoubtedly the most cited algorithm text book. However this is by no means an intro book. A lot of the materials 
 covered here are intended for formal undergrad and grad level algorithm courses. If you can, this is one of the best 
 book to study; if you can master this book, you can call yourself a master of algorithms. I specially liked graph 
 related topics here during my sophomore/junior year algorithm class. However, I think this is less accessible for some 
 readers.

- **Skiena** -- Steven S. Skiena is well known in fields of algorithms, programming challenges and data science. His 
 [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) 2e balances between practical applications of algorithms and 
 academic study of it. This book is organized in two parts: (1) text on algorithms and data structures & (2) catalog of 
 algorithms. He resorts to mathematics less often and explains things in detail. This is a nice book to study with and 
 keep as reference material. 

- **DPV** -- [Algorithms](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/book/index.html) by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani. 
 This book's PDF is officially available for [free
 ](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) online. People have mixed opinion about it. 
 IMHO, this is a well balanced and venerable algorithm text. This tends to jump too quickly into mathematics; so if you 
 are not math savvy, then this might seem difficult to you. I haven't studied the book in depth yet, but one thing I 
 liked about the contents is that, it appears to be industry appropriate. It breaks up algorithms into classes, 
 and teaches you how to recognize what kind of algorithm should be used to solve a particular problem.


#### Algorithms Refresher

- [**Algorithms Unlocked**](http://a.co/d/egtBmR0) *[AU]* by Cormen (the C in CLRS) is a nice refresher. This is much 
 thinner than CLRS and is written more as a [tradebook
 ](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-algorithm-books-CLRS-and-the-Algorithms-Unlocked/answers/7930807) 
 than as a text reference. 
 
- [**TopCoder Tutorials**](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/) lists some great 
 articles written by the TopCoder competitive programming community over the years. "They are very informal, which lets 
 them stay short and to the point - a luxury no serious algorithm book can afford. The goal of these tutorials is to 
 refresh your knowledge if you studied these algorithms before, or to give you an initial direction in exploring a 
 particular group of algorithms." -- [竊余(https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/165368)
 
- [Software Engineering Interview Preparation
](https://orrsella.gitbooks.io/soft-eng-interview-prep/content/) -- an executive summary of theoretical stuff needed
for such interviews. Comes with a tie-in [blog post
](https://orrsella.com/2016/05/14/preparing-for-a-facebook-google-software-engineer-interview/).


#### Interview Prep Books

- Virtually everyone is familiar with [**Cracking the Coding Interview**](http://a.co/d/73OhN0n) *[CTCI]* 
 by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and probably you would be benefited from it too. 

- [Programming Interviews Exposed](http://a.co/d/67c44hm) *[PI-Exposed]* by John Mongan et al. is a very basic book 
 for people who are totally uninitiated. If *CTCI* seems difficult for you, you can pick this up to build some 
 foundation. 



## Video Lectures

> There some really good lectures on fundamentals of computer science and on some on interview prep

- [**CS50 2017** - Lecture 0 - Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM) -- Harvard's CS50 lectures are 
 famous and now most of them are available online. This is a good intro. 

- [**Jackson Gabbard**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcdCkJKXlRoXVD03eo-q8mQ/videos), one of the early Facebook 
 engineers, made some really great video lectures circa 2016-2017.

- [**CTCI**/Cracking the Coding Interview lectures on **HackerRank**
 ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuZYwbmgZWXvkghUyMLdI90IwxbNCiWK) -- Gayle Laakmann McDowell,
 author of CTCI made a series of video lectures in collaboration with HackerRank in 2016.

- [**MyCodeSchool**](https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool) -- YouTube videos explaining fundamentals of computer 
 sciences (data structures and algorithms).


## Courses

### MOOCs on Algorithm, Data Structures etc.

- [**Tim Roughgarden**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms), a Stanford Professor, offers a 4 part
 algorithms course on Coursera. This is one of the earliest algorithms course on Coursera and is well received. 

- **UCSD** offers [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) 
 Specialization on Coursera with 6 well designed courses. 

- [**Sedgewick**](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~250165) -- the famous author offers a course in two parts:
 [Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and 
 [part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2).
 


### Interview Prep Courses
- [**Udemy** Technical Interview](https://eu.udacity.com/course/technical-interview--ud513) -- "This course provides 
 an introduction to topics that often show up on technical interviews." Also check out their other courses about 
 [career](https://eu.udacity.com/courses/career) in software engineering. 

- 汳 [**InterviewBit**](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/) has six tracks: Programming, System Design, Scripting,
 Databases, Mock Interviews and Puzzles. Their courses are, in a nutshell, genius. It is organized as gamified 
 levels. Each level has some tutorials and then relevant problems/challenges. You have to achieve certain score
 to unlock next level. This, imho, is very affective. You can learn fundamentals of comp-sci and solve interview 
 style problems side-by-side in a well structured plan. 

- [**Interview Camp**](https://interviewcamp.io/) -- created by 
 Harsh Goel[竊余(https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-goel-076756b/), who worked for NetApp, Google and sold his Pext app 
 to Pinterest. From the looks of it, this seems to be a good camp; but this is paid content and I haven't purchased it 
 yet.

- [**Interview Cake**](https://www.interviewcake.com/table-of-contents) -- this is money-back guarantee freemium 
 interactive course. The reading materials are free, but interactive problem solving steps are not. 



## Coding Practice

> Best way to sharpen your algorithm and problem solving skills is by engaging in 
 [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming). But if 
 [ACM](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/), 
 [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/) or 
 [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) are not your cups of tea, then you can resort to one of the following:

- [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) -- This site originally hosted some two-three hundred programming
 interview problems. It was run by Winston Tang[竊余(https://www.linkedin.com/in/winston-tang/), an engineer at Google,
 Amazon and Intel. Recently he started working full time on LeetCode and since, the problem archive has grew to about 
 a thousand. It now also organizes contests regularly, resulting in the surge of problems. First two-three hundred 
 problems cover a wide range of everything; so you do not have to solve all 900 of them. Also, a good thing about this 
 site is that, with premium subscription, you can filter problems by company tags. So, if you are preparing for a 
 particular company, you can review their trend. 
  - My personal suggestion is to, solve a few problems everyday and not to exhaust yourself. They also have a revisit 
  and favorite list. You should definitely utilize these. Also, [session](https://leetcode.com/session/) is a nice 
  feature. 
 
- [**HackerRank**](https://www.hackerrank.com/) evolved from InterviewStreet. It originally provided a tool for 
 companies to arrange online coding tests. Later, they started HackerRank for programmers to practice and solve coding
 problems. Their problem set ranges nicely from ACM/TopCoder style competitive programming problems to technical 
 interview focused problems. 
  - They now have a [Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)
  - I like how they have arranged their problems in different [domains](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/)
  - They also arrange [contests](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests) -- some of them are often sponsored and doing well
  on them may result in direct interview invite. 
  - [ProjectEuler+](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges?) is a nice touch on 
  [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). 

- [**InterviewBit**](https://www.interviewbit.com/) -- organizes contests, collaborates with software companies and has
 some wonderful prep courses. 
 
- [**GeeksforGeeks**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) -- it has a lot of articles, some are really good while some are 
 meh. So use with caution. I have found a lot of their explanations to be spot on and very useful in understanding 
 difficult problems. 


## Mock Interview
> Doing some mock interview is a good idea. Specially, if you can get feedback. 

- [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) - anonymous interview with potential employers. Interviews are conducted
 by engineers from companies that are actually hiring; after a successful interview the company may ask you to unmusk 
 if they want to bring in for on-site. 

- [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/) "is a FREE, online peer-2-peer platform for practicing technical interviews." It 
 matches you with other engineers for doing 1-on-1 video sessions. 


## On Rﾃｩsumﾃｩ
- Joel on [Getting Your Rﾃｩsumﾃｩ Read](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/01/26/getting-your-resume-read/)

- Both *CTCI* and *PI-Exposed* have very good sections on resume. Look at them. 



## Off-topic
> Since you are here, and I got you reading this far, I am going to share some of my favorite resources. These do not 
 directly help you in acing your technical interview but they are really useful to software engineers in general.

- 笶､ [**Programming Pearls** (2e)](http://a.co/d/dVi3IYb) by Jon Bentley -- some time tested articles originally 
 published on CACM. 

- [**Joel on Software**](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) *[JoS]* -- Joel Spolsky, the guy behind StackOverflow, 
 Trello, FogCreek and other wonderful things, posts read-worthy articles here. 


- [**Project Euler**](https://projecteuler.net) -- a collection of mathematical problems for which answers can be found
 using computer programs.
