Preparing for software engineering interview needs time, attention and practice; and to help with that, there are many 
resources sprinkled all over the internet and bookshelves. Some of them are wonderful and some of them are meh. Browsing
through these can be overwhelming.  

Therefore, I have tried to create ***a curated list of resources*** -- these are just some of the good options you can 
chose from. To help you decide on which resource to try, I have annotated each item.   
By no means, you have to go through all of it. I do not claim that, these are the best resources out there either; there
must be resources I don't know about which are even better and there might be some resources which I haven't included 
but is useful to someone else.  

I would suggest you to go through some of the articles and look at some of the study plans. Then pick one learning 
resource (book/course/lecture series) and one practice resource. It is best to learn something everyday and practice a
bit everyday. 

*Good luck & have fun!*

## Study Plans and Reading Lists
- **[Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)** -- this became a wildly 
 popular compendium of resources for self-paced software engineering training. John Washam wanted to gear up himself 
 as a software engineer and embarked on an [8 month long journey
 ](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13) 
 towards being an skilled software engineer. This study plan is overly comprehensive and as John mentioned, several 
 times, you do not need to go through everything he went through. My personal recommendation is to go through some of 
 the articles and pick up at least one algorithm book (more on it later) and one coding prep book/website (more on it 
 later as well). This directory lists a lot of good reading material on specific topic collected from various sources; 
 don't be voracious, eat healthy and read (study) as needed.

## On Books
> There are plethora of books on algorithms, problem solving, software engineering and computer science in general.
 There are also, as many book-lists. One thing, I'd like to mention is that, picking up a good book is important. 
 In many cases people are in a time crunch. So, you want to study a book which you can cover within a limited time; 
 similarly, you would want to learn enough and understand them correctly. 
>
> There are people who have studied and compared a good number of books. What they have to say about these books can 
 give you sufficient insight for picking up the right book. 

- [Shawn Bullock's Quora answer on best algorithms and data structures books
 ](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-on-algorithms-and-data-structures/answer/Shawn-Bullock-7) -- this 
 answer is probably one of the most comprehensive overview of good algorithm books. I mostly agree with him, except, I 
 have much more reverence for CLRS than he has. I'm glad that he likes Sedgewick too. 

- [Programming Algorithms & Data Structures
 ](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/126971.Programming_Algorithms_Data_Structures) -- a Goodreads list of well 
 recognized and revered books on programming algorithms, data structures, problem solving and programming challenges.

- [A comparison of four algorithms 
 textbooks](https://porgionesanke.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/a-comparison-of-four-algorithms-textbooks/): 
 Knuth, CLRS, DPV, Skiena.

- An [annotated list of programming books](https://danluu.com/programming-books/) by Dan Luu.


### Book List
> Following are some books I studied or vetted and are in my to-read list.

See also: [r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_books](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_books)

#### Algorithms and data structures

- 🚀 **Sedgewick** -- I read his [Algorithms in C++](http://a.co/d/9cUnqJI) during my freshman and sophomore years and I 
 loved how he handled some very intricate topics. Later on I also looked at the more updated 
 [Algorithms 4e](http://a.co/d/0LDYqsh) in conjunction with his Coursera courses 
 [1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), 
 [2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2). Another book he authored focuses on 
 [analysis of algorithms](http://aofa.cs.princeton.edu/) and thus more mathematical in nature. 

- 📜 **CLRS** -- [Introduction to Algorithms (3e)](http://a.co/d/aVnF8Eu) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein -- this 
 is undoubtedly the most cited algorithm text book. However this is by no means an intro book. A lot of the materials 
 covered here are intended for formal undergrad and grad level algorithm courses. This is one of the best book to study;
 if you can master this book, you can call yourself a master of algorithms. I specially liked graph  related topics here 
 during my sophomore/junior year algorithm class. However, I think this is less accessible for some readers.

- **Skiena** -- Steven S. Skiena is well known in fields of algorithms, programming challenges and data science. His 
 [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) 2e balances between practical applications of algorithms and 
 academic study of it. This book is organized in two parts: (1) text on algorithms and data structures & (2) catalog of 
 algorithms. He resorts to mathematics less often and explains things in detail. This is a nice book to study with and 
 keep as reference material. 

- **DPV** -- [Algorithms](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/book/index.html) by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani. 
 This book's [PDF↗](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) is officially available 
 for free online. People have mixed opinion about it. IMHO, this is a well balanced and venerable algorithm text. This 
 tends to jump too quickly into mathematics; so if you are not math savvy, then this might seem difficult to you. I 
 haven't studied the book in depth yet, but one thing I liked about the contents is that, it appears to be industry 
 appropriate. It breaks up algorithms into classes, and teaches you how to recognize what kind of algorithm should be
 used to solve a particular problem.


#### Algorithms Refresher

- [**Algorithms Unlocked**](http://a.co/d/egtBmR0) *[AU]* by Cormen (the C in CLRS) is a nice refresher. This is much 
 thinner than CLRS and is written more as a [tradebook
 ](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-algorithm-books-CLRS-and-the-Algorithms-Unlocked/answers/7930807) 
 than as a text reference. 
 
- [**TopCoder Tutorials**](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/) lists some great 
 articles written by the TopCoder competitive programming community over the years. "They are very informal, which lets 
 them stay short and to the point - a luxury no serious algorithm book can afford. The goal of these tutorials is to 
 refresh your knowledge if you studied these algorithms before, or to give you an initial direction in exploring a 
 particular group of algorithms." -- [↗](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/165368)
 
- [Software Engineering Interview Preparation
](https://orrsella.gitbooks.io/soft-eng-interview-prep/content/) -- an executive summary of theoretical stuff needed
for such interviews. Comes with a tie-in [blog post
](https://orrsella.com/2016/05/14/preparing-for-a-facebook-google-software-engineer-interview/).


#### Interview Prep Books

- Virtually everyone is familiar with [**Cracking the Coding Interview**](http://a.co/d/73OhN0n) 🌟 *[CTCI]* 
 by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and probably you would be benefited from it too. Solutions are posted on 
 [Github](https://github.com/careercup/ctci) in several languages. 

- [Programming Interviews Exposed](http://a.co/d/67c44hm) *[PI-Exposed]* by John Mongan et al. is a very basic book 
 for people who are totally uninitiated. If *CTCI* seems difficult for you, you can pick this up to build some 
 foundation. 

#### Design & Development

- [**Designing Data-Intensive Applications**](http://a.co/d/aJqTIcD) -- The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and 
 Maintainable Systems by Martin Kleppmann 



## Video Lectures

> There are some really good lectures on fundamentals of computer science and some on interview prep.

- [**CS50 2017** - Lecture 0 - Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM) -- Harvard's CS50 lectures are 
 famous and now most of them are available online. This is a good intro. 

- [**Jackson Gabbard**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcdCkJKXlRoXVD03eo-q8mQ/videos), one of the early Facebook 
 engineers, made some really great video lectures circa 2016-2017.

- [**CTCI**/Cracking the Coding Interview lectures on **HackerRank**
 ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuZYwbmgZWXvkghUyMLdI90IwxbNCiWK) -- Gayle Laakmann McDowell,
 author of CTCI made a series of video lectures in collaboration with HackerRank in 2016.

- [**MyCodeSchool**](https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool) -- YouTube videos explaining fundamentals of computer 
 sciences (data structures and algorithms).


## Online Learning Resources

### MOOCs on Algorithm, Data Structures etc.

- [**Tim Roughgarden**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms), a Stanford Professor, offers a 4 part
 algorithms course on Coursera. This is one of the earliest algorithms course on Coursera and is well received. 

- **UCSD** offers [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) 
 Specialization on Coursera with 6 well designed courses. 

- [**Sedgewick**](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~250165) -- the famous author offers a course in two parts:
 [Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and 
 [part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2).
 
 - Grow Your Technical Skills [**with Google**](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/)
 


### Interview Prep Courses
- [**Udemy** Technical Interview](https://eu.udacity.com/course/technical-interview--ud513) -- "This course provides 
 an introduction to topics that often show up on technical interviews." Also check out their other courses about 
 [career](https://eu.udacity.com/courses/career) in software engineering. 

- 💎 [**InterviewBit**](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/) has six tracks: Programming, System Design, Scripting,
 Databases, Mock Interviews and Puzzles. Their courses are, in a nutshell, genius. It is organized as gamified 
 levels. Each level has some tutorials and then relevant problems/challenges. You have to achieve certain score
 to unlock next level. This, imho, is very affective. You can learn fundamentals of comp-sci and solve interview 
 style problems side-by-side in a well structured plan. 

- [**Interview Camp**](https://interviewcamp.io/) -- created by 
 Harsh Goel[↗](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-goel-076756b/), who worked for NetApp, Google and sold his Pext app 
 to Pinterest. From the looks of it, this seems to be a good camp; but this is paid content and I haven't purchased it 
 yet.

- [**Interview Cake**](https://www.interviewcake.com/table-of-contents) -- this is money-back guarantee freemium 
 interactive course. The reading materials are free, but interactive problem solving steps are not. 
 
- [**Hired in Tech**](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/algorithm-design/lesson/77) -- Algorithm design 


### Design & Development

- [**Software Development Process**](https://www.udacity.com/course/software-development-process--ud805) on Udacity, 
 in collaboration with GATech; also part of Georgia Tech's Online Masters Degree (OMS) as CS6300. Lead by 
 [Alex Orso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wCfYkMkAAAAJ&hl=en).

- UIUC offers a [**Cloud Computing**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloud-computing) specialization on 
 Coursera. It has 5 courses, 2 on cloud computing concepts, 2 on applications of it, 1 on cloud network and one capstone
 project. Looks interesting. A more succinct course could be better, but this offers more up to date understanding of 
 this now growing field. 


## Coding Practice

> Best way to sharpen your algorithm and problem solving skills is by engaging in 
 [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming). But if 
 [ACM](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/), 
 [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/) or 
 [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) are not your cups of tea, then you can resort to one of the following:

- [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) -- This site originally hosted some two-three hundred programming
 interview problems. It is run by Winston Tang[↗](https://www.linkedin.com/in/winston-tang/), an engineer at Google,
 Amazon and Intel. Recently he started working full time on LeetCode and since, the problem archive has grew to about 
 a thousand. It now also organizes contests regularly, resulting in the surge of problems. First two-three hundred 
 problems cover a wide range of everything; so you do not have to solve all 900 of them. Also, a good thing about this 
 site is that, with premium subscription, you can filter problems by company tags. So, if you are preparing for a 
 particular company, you can review their trend. 
  - My personal suggestion is to, solve a few problems everyday and not to exhaust yourself. They also have a revisit 
  and favorite list. You should definitely utilize these. Also, [session](https://leetcode.com/session/) is a nice 
  feature.  
 
- [**HackerRank**](https://www.hackerrank.com/) evolved from InterviewStreet. It originally provided a tool for 
 companies to arrange online coding tests. Later, they started HackerRank for programmers to practice and solve coding
 problems. Their problem set ranges nicely from ACM/TopCoder style competitive programming problems to technical 
 interview focused problems. 
  - They now have a [Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)
  - I like how they have arranged their problems in different [domains](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/)
  - They also arrange [contests](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests) -- some of them are often sponsored and doing well
  on them may result in direct interview invite. 
  - [ProjectEuler+](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges?) is a nice touch on 
  [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).  

- [**InterviewBit**](https://www.interviewbit.com/) -- organizes contests, collaborates with software companies and has
 some wonderful prep courses.
 
- [**GeeksforGeeks**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) -- it has a lot of articles, some are really good while some are 
 meh. So use with caution. I have found a lot of their explanations to be spot on and very useful in understanding 
 difficult problems.

</p>



## Mock Interview
> Doing some mock interview is a good idea. Specially, if you can get feedback. 

- [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) - anonymous interview with potential employers. Interviews are conducted
 by engineers from companies that are actually hiring; after a successful interview the company may ask you to unmusk 
 if they want to bring in for on-site. 

- [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/) "is a FREE, online peer-2-peer platform for practicing technical interviews." It 
 matches you with other engineers for doing 1-on-1 video sessions. 



## Cheat sheets
- [**VisuAlgo**](https://visualgo.net/en) -- visually explains algorithms and data structures in action. 
 By Steven Halim.

- [Cracking the Coding Skills
](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf) -- from CTCI 
 companion website.


## On Résumé
- Joel on [Getting Your Résumé Read](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/01/26/getting-your-resume-read/)

- Both *CTCI* and *PI-Exposed* have very good sections on resume. Look at them. 



## Soft Skills
- [7 Software Engineer Interview Questions and Answers](https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/software-engineer)
- [Software engineer interview questions](https://resources.workable.com/software-engineer-interview-questions)

## Official Guides
> Software industry is probably that odd industry where they reveal all secrets about their interview process. 
> Most large companies have standardized their interview process so much so that, and they want interviewees to succeed
so much that they actively generate and provide prep materials.

## Even if you are not interviewing
> Since you are here, and I got you reading this far, I am going to share some of my favorite resources. These do not 
 directly help you in acing your technical interview but they are really useful to software engineers in general.

- [**Write Code Every Day**](https://johnresig.com/blog/write-code-every-day/) -- how
  John Resig[↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Resig), creator of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) picked up pace for
  his pet project(s). 

- ❤ [**Programming Pearls** (2e)](http://a.co/d/dVi3IYb) by Jon Bentley -- some time tested articles originally 
 published on CACM. 

- [**Joel on Software**](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) *[JoS]* -- Joel Spolsky, the guy behind StackOverflow, 
 Trello, FogCreek and other wonderful things, posts read-worthy articles here. 

- [**Project Euler**](https://projecteuler.net) -- a collection of mathematical problems for which answers can be found
 using computer programs. 

## Job Channels
> I found the following channels to be a good source for job search:

- [**Triplebyte**](https://triplebyte.com/iv/KKhrz2Q/cp/header) -- Triplebyte is a platform which makes finding new
opportunities and hiring great talent - both easier. First anyone can take their online quiz. This is a comprehensive 
quiz covering various topics a generalist software engineer is expected to know. Don't worry, none of these are tricky
or arcane. If you pass this quiz you are invited to schedule a 2hr Skype interview. You'd be provided enough prep 
material for those. Once you pass this step, you'ld be matched with upto 200 potential companies based on your skills 
and interests. They'd also send you some really nice swag (I got an wireless charger and a nice jacket). Their portfolio 
includes a lot of top tier companies. Once you match with some companies, they'd give you pitch calls to tell you about
their job opportunities. Then you are expected to set up 3-5 on-site interviews. They'd arrange them in a way so that 
you can just travel once and be done with it. There have been historically a 50% on-site to offer rate. So, if you go 
for 5 on-sites you'd easily get 2-3 offers to chose from. One thing great about this service is that, they eliminate the
messy sourcing and phone screening steps. Another great thing is that, you can arrange your interviews together making 
it easy to secure multiple offers in a short window. On top of all that, Triplebyte will give you three grands if you 
accept and offer through them. 

- [**Hired.com**](https://hired.com/x/3fomt) -- After you sign up with them, they'd review your profile and one hiring 
advocate may have a phone chat with you to better understand your profile and career goal. They usually focus on 
candidates in (located at or willing to relocated to) major US tech hubs such as SF Bay Area, NYC etc. They advise on 
your career progression and once you are ready your profile would go live for 1-2 weeks. Going live means, your profile
will be advertised to a pool of potential employers who in turn will contact with you about potential opportunities. 
I found [Hired.com](https://hired.com/x/3fomt) to be very useful. On top of hooking up to a lot of good employers, you'd
get a cash bonus if you get hired through them.
